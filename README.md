## Overview and Origin 

### Company History

TJX was discovered in `1947' by Bernard (Ben) Cammarata.



> In 1976 Ben was recruited by discount retailer, Zyre Corp. to develop and lead the ðŸ’¡idea of off-price chain.  Under Mr. Cammarataâ€™s leadership, TJ Maxx was born, with its first stores opening in 1977. In the late 1980s, Zayre was restructured and spun off three of its brands â€” TJ Maxx, Hit or Miss, and Chadwickâ€™s of Boston â€” which served as the initial retail banners of what would become The TJX Companies, Inc. 

* Executing off-price business model  has  allowed TJX to deliver steady sales and earnings growth through many retail and economic environments. Over the course of the company history,  strong financial results and cash flow generation have allowed them to secure funds to invest in the growth of the business and return significant value to  shareholders. Company's strong sales and profitability performance in Fiscal 2024 underscores  great confidence in the outlook for their business.  

* As the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, TJX delivers great value on ever-changing selections of high quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise at prices generally 20%-60% below full-price retailersâ€™ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices, on comparable merchandise, every day.

* Its buyers are opportunistic and entrepreneurial. When a designer or manufacturer overproduces or other stores overbuy, we swoop in, negotiate the best possible price, and pass the savings on.Our buyers are on the hunt throughout the year for the hottest brand name and designer merchandise for the entire family and home â€” from trendy tops and handbags, to bold ties and footwear, to gourmet cookware and furniture, to hiking gear and active wear.

* TJX buy from all kinds of vendors: big brand names to boutique, designer labels, as well as up-and-coming labels and exciting gems from around the globe. They also have some merchandise manufactured for us to bring our customers exceptional fashion and quality at an amazing price. Company's buyers choose many different colors, styles, fabrics, and materials so there are always lots of great choices.
